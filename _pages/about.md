Hello! My name is Ben! Welcome to my website!

I am currently a Mathematics Ph.D. Candidate at Purdue University. My advisor is Professor Bernd Ulrich.

My main research interest is commutative algebra. Specifically, I am interested in Liaison and Gorenstein-Liaison theory, as well as combinatorial commutative algebra and related topics. When not doing math, I spend most of my time developing and implementing new and inventive methods of annoying my cat, Calliope.

If you are interested in talking math, please feel free to reach out! My contact information can be found on this page.
