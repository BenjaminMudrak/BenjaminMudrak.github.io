Hello! My name is Ben! Welcome to my website!

I am currently a Mathematics Ph.D. Candidate at Purdue University. My advisor is Professor Bernd Ulrich.

My main research interest is commutative algebra. Specifically, I am interested in Liaison and Gorenstein-Liaison theory, as well as combinatorial commutative algebra and related topics.
