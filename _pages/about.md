Hello! My name is Ben! Welcome to my website!

I am currently a Mathematics Ph.D. Candidate at Purdue University. My advisor is Professor [Bernd Ulrich.](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~bulrich/)

My main research interest is commutative algebra. Specifically, I am interested in Liaison and Gorenstein-Liaison theory, as well as combinatorial commutative algebra and related topics. When not doing math, I spend most of my time developing (and implementing) new and exciting ways to annoy my cat, Calliope.

This upcoming (2025/2026) academic year, I'll be one of the Purdue Math Department Grad Reps! More information, along with upcoming department events, can be found here: [Purdue Grad Reps.](https://sites.google.com/site/pumareps/). I will also be co-organizing [Ideal Conversations](https://sites.google.com/view/ideal-conversations/home) (the Purdue Student Commutative Algebra Seminar) and the Purdue Bridge to Research Seminar. Information about Purdue math seminars can be found here: [Purdue Math Seminars](https://sites.google.com/site/pumareps/seminars). 

During Fall 2025, I will be teaching Math as a Profession and a Discipline (MA 10800). If you are a student in this class, all relevant information and important course-communications may be found on the course's Brightspace page. 

If you are a new/potential math grad student at Purdue and have any questions about the department (or are interested in talking math) feel free to reach out! My contact information can be found on this page.
